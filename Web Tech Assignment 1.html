    <h1><b><u>Basketball Maestro</u></b></h1>
    <p>Basketball is one of the most interesting sports that is loved by millions worldwide which makes it dynamic </p>
    <p>The reason as to why I love it is because it is a fast paced and high energy sport which has a lot of creativity in it.
        One of the players I enjoy watching most is Ja Morant due to his technical ability on and of the ball.
        This makes him one of the greatest to play the sport.</p>
